# FT-BPM (Fourier Transform Beam Propagation Method) for plasmonics

This repository provides an efficient way of calculating far filed response on a planer metal-dielectric interface. The file 'FT_BPM_and_Lumerical.m' provides the field usign FT_BPM and compares the result with numerically (Lumerical-FDTD) obtained fields.
